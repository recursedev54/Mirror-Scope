  - ### DEF Notation - Brand new music notation system
    - Called DEF notation, inspired by ABC notation but 1-1 compatable with midi, meaning every midi clip in the daw can be 'flipped' to show its DEF notation counterpart
    - DEF notation looks like this:
      - ```Audicle{Bass}>> >>C#2 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | F#1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | B1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | A1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |```
      - ```Audicle{Keyboard}>> >>C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . | C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . E4 . C#4 . B3 . | C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . | C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . E4 .

    - Unlike ABC notation, DEF notation fully supports drums
      - ```Audicle{Backbeat}>> >>B B . . S . . S . B B . . . S . | B B . B S . . S . . B B S . B S | B . . . S . . S . . B B S . B S | B . B . . . S . B B B B B B B B |```

  - ### Rainbow Piano Roll
    - Finally you don't have to settle for just one color for each of your midi clips. Rainbow midi means you're easily able to tell which note is which. You can make each note of the chromatic scale whatever you want, but these are the defaults

  - ### Rainbow Tracks
    - Much like the rainbow piano roll, you can color each track in the timeline whatever you want, using any hex code, or even use multiple for a gradient, or animate between multiple for an rainbow RGB effect.
  - ### Real Voice Cloning
    - Train and clone your own and other voices and apply them directly onto vocal tracks without any confusing popups or processes
    - The Mirror Company includes some propriotary voices, and lets you train your own models and datasets as you see fit, respecting voice actor autonomy and musician experimentation.
  - ### The World Soul
    - Generate audio clips from mad-libs style text prompts sourcing public domain from the 1920s and pre-1920s!
    - The Mirror Company believes strongly in artist intellectual property and does not train on any copyrighted material period, but you are welcome to fine tune the model as you see fit


#### Mirror (Prismals)

###### `~The Game!
- Prismals is the block breaking and building component of Mirror. It's a semi prodecural game in the vein of minecraft, with a heavy emphasis on story elements, strongly written character, and exploration of technology and magic
    - # What is a Prismal?
      - A Prismal is an entity made of light. All characters and animals and entities in Mirror (Prismals) are prismals. there are several kinds you will meet on your journey through the Prismals universe.
          - ### Monstrous Prismals
              - These are the enemies of the Prismals Game, there are numerous kinds who will challenge your combat skills and threaten the world of Prismals if not defeated
                - #### Skinwalkers
                    - Shape-shifting Abilities: Skinwalkers can mimic the appearance of other creatures, allowing them to blend in and approach unsuspecting players. They often lurk in the shadows and stalk players from a distance.
                    - Goofy Tactics: Despite their menacing nature, Skinwalkers often employ humorous and quirky tactics, adding a unique blend of fear and amusement to encounters.
                    - Invasion Focus: They are primarily focused on infiltrating player bases, using their shape-shifting abilities to bypass defenses and create chaos within.
                    - Skinwalkers are not just random enemies but part of a larger faction, forming camps and led by the Skinwalker King. Players will need to develop strategies to identify and combat these shape-shifters, invade the enemy base and take it down.
                       - The skinwalker king as a main antagonist creates a central conflict that players can choose to engage with or ignore.
                       - The day night cycle will mirror your real life timezone, so you can potentially avoid skinwalkers completely if you don’t play at night.
                       - Skinwalkers will employ goofy tactics like standing on each others shoulders to get into your base, but I’m also excited that they will be scary- if one finds you out in the wild it will stalk you and prey on you and will probably be pretty terrifying
                    - SkinwalkerA
                       - SkinwalkerA is a unique threat and somewhat of a super soldier among the skinwalker faction. SkinwalkerA was "born differant" and possess incredible speed strength agility edurance and toughness, regeneration, as well as being the only skinwalker able to weild magick
                       - SkinwalkerA's actions, even when hostile, sometimes betray a hint of reluctance or inner conflict.
                       - SkinwalkerA is the kings loyal knight. The king maintains power because he’s a good ruler and military leader and would squash anyone who rebels. When you kill skinwalkerA it’s revealed much later that he actually survived, and then there is the chance to have some sort of reconciliation and understanding. This would only be revealed after the skinwalker faction was taken down and the king killed by the player
                       -  Late post game when the player is fighting against some high level threat post-alien invasion, SkinwalkerA will appear and save the player from demise
                      -  The defeat of the skinwalker king culminate in the skinwalker faction being sucked into a wormhole that the player creates in the middle of their base which teleports all the skinwalkers to a mirror dimension, which will open lots of plot lines. If you want to keep the tower defense gameplay you can go to the mirror dimension and make a new base, or if you want to keep it in the main dimension you can just make sure you don’t trigger the wormhole or kill the skinwalker king and it will keep going. Otherwise you can basically get rid of the skinwalkers in the main dimension this way so that you can have a totally cozy farm world where you can build. This is the first main ending of the game
                      -  in the mirror world it’s night when it’s day in the main world and vice versa, and furthermore the sun is very dim. if you decide to travel there, the skinwalkers have the upper hand now.
                       - The reversed cycle could introduce new nocturnal plants and animals unique to this dimension.
                       - Players might need to create artificial "daylight" to ward off skinwalkers or grow certain crops.
                       - Players could potentially create portals to briefly access the main world during its "day" for resources or respite.
                       - Very late in this second act of the skinwalker arc, the player can become a skinwalker (known as the shinwalker), and also it is revealed there is another skinwalker like SkinwalkerA known as SkinwalkerB
                       - It is revealed that this Mirror Dimension is actually *Mira's World* and letting the Skinwalker faction loose here sets in motion a lot of the tension the propels the narritive forward from here. Misc. Points 1. no lone walkers dont call in reinforcements, it just doesnt really fit the vibe. the reason they are scary in the first place is becuase of the feeling like youre being watched by something behind that tree or something or other. its not about being overwealmed by a pack of wolves and feeling defenceless, its about the feeling that you could be currently being stalked by just one wolf and youll have to give all your might to save yourself ((replace wolf with skinwalker))
2. yes there are elite skinwalkers. SkinwalkerA and SkinwalkerB are the main ones, but there are also skinwalker mini bosses. Skinwalker(#79346541987), Skinwalker(#23), Skinwalker (#67) Skinwalker(#6,#7), $kinwalker (4), and Skinwalker (3)
                - ## Aliens
                    - The Aliens are a formidable late game threat in the Mirror (Prismals) world. These creatures see humans as a delicacy and are determined to invade and dominate the world of Mirror. Players will encounter different types of aliens, each with its own unique characteristics and roles within their society.
                    - Alien Types
                      - Orange-skinned Aliens:
                        - Ferocious Beasts: Resembling canid-like tentacle creatures, these aliens are known for their incredible speed, agility and ferocity. They often act as the vanguard in alien assaults, using melee attacks and razor sharp teeth.

                        - Master Disguisers: These cat-like antrhopomorphic aliens possess the ability to disguise themselves, similar to Skinwalkers. They can blend into their surroundings and mimic other entities, making them difficult to spot.
                        - Stealth Operatives: Cyan-skinned aliens are similar in nature to skinwalkers, but more intelligent, sabotaging and terrifying the players efforts from the shadows using psychological warfare and razor sharp claws.
                      - Green-skinned Aliens:
                        - Reconnaissance Agents: Bearing a more human-like appearance, green-skinned aliens operate as spies, blending into human society to gather information and execute covert operations.
                        - General Populace: They are the most commonly encountered aliens, often seen mingling with humans to study their behavior and report back to their leaders.

                    - Alien Invasion
                      - The alien faction poses a serious threat to the Mirror world, with their ultimate goal being the complete subjugation of humanity. Players will need to thwart their plans by identifying and eliminating alien operatives, disrupting their reconnaissance missions, and ultimately taking the fight to the alien mothership themselves.
                      - Key Objectives:
                        - Preventing Invasion: Players must prevent alien invasions by defending key locations and neutralizing alien forces before they can establish a foothold.
                        - Infiltrating the Mothership: In a high-stakes mission inspired by secret agent tales, players will need to infiltrate the alien mothership, plant explosives, and bring down the alien threat from within.
                        - Defeating Alien Leaders: Confronting and defeating the red-skinned alien leaders is crucial to dismantling the alien command structure and ensuring the safety of the Mirror world.
                        - The aliens in Mirror are not just generic invaders; they are a well-organized and multifaceted threat that requires players to be strategic and resourceful in their approach. By understanding the different alien types and their roles, players can develop effective strategies to combat this otherworldly menace.
                - ## Demons
                  - The Demons are the third primary antagonistic forces in the Mirror world, drawn directly from the 72 demons of the Lesser Key of Solomon. These entities are powerful, cunning, and imbued with unique personalities and abilities. In Mirror, they are personified and cartoonified into goofy, charismatic characters.
                  - Demon Hierarchy
                    - In keeping with the structure of the Lesser Key of Solomon, demons in Mirror are organized into various ranks and titles, each representing different levels of power and influence. The ranks include:
                      - Dukes
                      - Presidents
                      - Marquises
                      - Counts
                      - Princes
                      - Kings
                  - Each demon retains its historical name and attributes but is given a unique, whimsical personality that makes encounters memorable and engaging.
                  - Named Entities: Each demon is a named entity from the Lesser Key of Solomon, such as Bael, Astaroth, and Paimon. These characters are brought to life with distinct traits and characteristics, transforming them into memorable adversaries.
                  - Goofy and Charismatic: Inspired by the playful and humorous portrayal of traditionally menacing figures, these demons are depicted in a light-hearted yet menacing manner. They add a unique blend of comedy, mysticism, and amusement to the game.
                  - Demon Abilities and Traits
                    - Magical Powers: Demons possess a range of magical abilities, from summoning minions and casting destructive spells to manipulating the environment. Each demon’s powers are tailored to their mythological origins, providing diverse challenges.
                    - Intelligent Tactics: Demons are not mindless creatures; they are cunning and intelligent, often employing complex strategies to defeat players. This makes encounters with them dynamic and challenging.
                    - Unique Personalities: Each demon has a distinct personality, often based on their mythological background. This adds a layer of narrative depth to their interactions with players, making each encounter unique.
                  - Demon Involvement
                    - Demons in Mirror are complex and multifaceted entities that, while mischievous and often dangerous, do not seek to harm the world at large. They are Machiavellian characters with their own agendas, ambitions, and schemes. Players will often find themselves entangled in the intricate plots of these demons, leading to epic confrontations and unexpected alliances.

                    - Key Objectives:
                      - Navigating Intrigue: Players must navigate the intricate plots and schemes of the demons, often getting involved in political and social intrigue. This can involve solving puzzles, uncovering secrets, and making strategic decisions.
                      - Confronting Demon Leaders: Many demons serve as major boss fights, requiring players to utilize all their skills and resources. These battles are not just about brute force but also understanding the demons’ tactics and exploiting their weaknesses.
                      - Forming Alliances: Not all interactions with demons are combative. Players can negotiate, make deals, and even form alliances with certain demons, using their unique abilities and insights to further their own goals.
                      - Befriending Demons
                        - A unique aspect of Mirror is the possibility of befriending certain demons. These entities, once defeated or outmaneuvered, can become valuable allies, offering their abilities and knowledge to aid players in their journey.
                    - Key Points:
                      - Post-encounter Interactions: After a demon is defeated or outwitted, players may have the option to engage in dialogues and build relationships with these entities, turning former enemies into allies.
                      - Unique Abilities: Befriended demons can offer special abilities or knowledge that can be crucial for overcoming future challenges. These abilities can range from magical powers to strategic insights, making them invaluable companions.
                    - ### Demon Bossfights and Characterization
                      - Every demon from the ars goetia's lesser key of somolon are represented in the game, and all of them are fully fleshed out characters. All of them (Except Gremory) have bossfights as well with unique weapons and fighting styles.
                        -  You reach the Nine Circles dimension in Pirsmals. You’re greeted by paimon. You expected some scary thing, but it’s just a winged red skin dude in a white dress shirt and tuxedo pants with suspenders and sunglasses 
“Welcome to hell, I’m paimon" Paimon could offer a deadpan, unenthusiastic tour of hell's attractions. He might complain about mundane aspects of running hell, like paperwork or union negotiations with lesser demons. Perhaps he's more interested in discussing earth pop culture than in tempting souls. Paimon's fight could be framed as a mandatory combat assessment for all new arrivals in hell.
                        - other demons find themselves in similarly incongruous situations:
                          - #### Astaroth's fight could be a deadly game show with increasingly absurd rules
                          - #### Buer (often depicted as a wheel) could challenge the player to a bizarre hellish version of Wheel of Fortune
                          - #### Furfur could host a lethal version of a weather forecast, attacking with overblown weather phenomena
                          - #### Barbados' fight has a Build-up: Other demons talking about Barbatos in hushed, fearful tones, Ominous music and atmosphere as the player approaches, Maybe even some intimidating environmental changes
                            - The Reveal:
                               - The music suddenly cuts to a funky beat, Barbatos slides into view doing the worm, He pops up, does a spin, and strikes a pose, His attacks are all dance-move based but devastatingly powerful
                                  - Moonwalk that creates shockwaves
                                  - Windmill kicks that generate tornados
                                  - Head spins that shoot laser beams
                                     - Each phase of the fight introduced by Barbatos scratching a record, Different dance styles for different phases (breakdancing, pop-and-lock, even ballroom for a curveball), Barbatos trash-talking through rap lyrics between attacks
                                     - The arena could transform into a giant dance floor, Disco balls that shoot deadly light beams, Dance-activated traps and hazards
                                     - Maybe the player has to "out-dance" Barbatos at certain points, Dodging could be rhythm-based, Attacks might need to be timed to the beat for maximum effect
                                  - Post-Fight:
                                     - Barbatos, out of breath, casually asks the player for feedback on his mixtape, Maybe he gives the player a signed copy of his album as a power-up

    - Countryside
    - Geyser Basin
      - Landscape: Characterized by numerous geothermal features including geysers, hot springs, mud pots, and fumaroles.
      - Geology: Formed by volcanic and tectonic activity, typically in areas with thin or fractured Earth's crust.
      - Water features: Contains various types of hot water features, ranging from violently erupting geysers to calm, colorful hot spring pools.
      - Microbial life: Home to unique extremophile microorganisms that thrive in high-temperature, often acidic environments.
      - Mineral deposits: Often displays colorful mineral formations and deposits around thermal features, created by dissolved minerals precipitating from the hot water.
    - Coniferous Forests
      - Trees: Dominated by cone-bearing trees (conifers) like pines, spruces, firs, and cedars.
      - Leaves: Have needle-like or scale-like leaves that typically remain green year-round.
      - Climate: Often found in cooler climates and higher altitudes.
      - Soil: Tend to have more acidic soil due to the decomposition of needles.
      - Biodiversity: Generally less diverse understory due to less light reaching the forest floor.
    - Deciduous Forests
      - Trees: Characterized by broad-leaved trees like oaks, maples, beeches, and birches.
      - Leaves: Have flat, broad leaves that change color and fall off in autumn.

- # General Mechanics (Prismals)
   - ## Mining
      - Right click and hold to charge up your pickaxe axe or shovel swing, left click to release and break a block. some blocks made of harder materials take multiple swings to break. some valueable materials like ores have a risk of not dropping and being destroyed if you use a tool that is too powerful, or you charge up the tool too much and dont use enough finesse.
      - Progress enough through the technology tree and you'll eventually be able to craft handheld drills. Right click and hold to charge up the drill, and left click to continuously break blocks in the direction you're aiming, but be careful not to waste fuel or electricity, or accidentally destroy a valueable ore by not paying attention to what you're mining.
      - Ores
        - Silver
           - Good and relatively easy to obtain metal for making weapons that are strong against skinwalkers, demons, and other unholy creatures. Can also be used to make tool heads. Good durability and strength
        - Quartz
           - Used for many tech recipes and magical implements due to its magical and technologically useful properties
        - Amethyst
           - Fiarly rare crystal, can be used to make high-mid tier tools, also has magical properties of positive energy. Mediocre durability but excellent strength
        - Ruby
           - can make tools with excellent strength and excellent durability, very rare, also is a very good conduit for magical imbuement
        - Bastnäsite (Neodymium)
           - Yellow, or reddish in color and forms in prismatic crystals or masses. Bastnäsite is a primary source of rare earth elements like neodymium.
           - Found in carbonatites and other igneous rocks, often in association with other rare earth minerals.
           - Can make neodynmium tools with excellent strength and excellent durrability that are capable of magitech augmentations
        - Fluorite
           - It can be found in a wide range of colors, including purple, green, yellow, blue, and clear. Fluorite crystals are typically cubic and can exhibit fluorescence under ultraviolet light.
           - Found in hydrothermal veins, often associated with minerals like quartz, calcite, and sulfides. It is also found in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.
           - Can make tools with mediocre durability and strength, can also make magical implements and is extremely good canidate for magical imbuement
        - Nephrite & Jadeite
          - Both forms of jade, both are quite rare and can be used to make tools and weapons that have good strength and durability. Good canidate for magical imbuement and magitech, but not as good as a magitech canidate as Neodymium, and not as good of a canidate for imbuement as ruby or flourite, but better than amethyst and quartz.
        - Meteorite
          - Very rare
          - Surface meteorites are often found by visual searches or metal detectors.
          - Underground meteorites might be discovered during mining operations, construction, or scientific excavations.
          - Can be used to make extremely strong and extremely durable tools that respond well to tech, magic, and magitech augmentations
   - ## Foliage System
     - Leaves can be walked through and stoof on but deal slight damage when run through. Leaves slow mobs down but not players and skinwalkers
     - A tree can be head butten by a prismal to reveal a prismal or item like fruit or some other object that may be in the tree
     - When a part of a tree is cut down, the top part of the tree will fall one block as if its effected by gravity, and the tree leaf blocks will fall too, every block falling at the same time as you cut the tree logs.
     - Trees logs give raw wood when cut down.
     - You can climb up logs

#### Mirror (DAWg)

###### `~How do the daw and the game connect?

- In many ways the DAW and the world of Prismals are seperate and distinct. this isnt like VR or AR music sequencers, and its not like minecraft noteblocks. In 'Iconic' mode, as well as in 'Robust' mode, you can access the daw by builing and ingame computer after aquiring sufficent technology fabrication tools and raw materials to create them. The player can complete achivements and questlines to unlock upgrades for their daw.
- There are basically two audio engines, the daw core and the game core audio engines. they mostly act as distinct and isolated engines.
