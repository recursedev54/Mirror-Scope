  - Brand new music notation system called DEF notation, inspired by ABC notation but 1-1 compatable with midi, meaning every midi clip in the daw can be 'flipped' to show its DEF notation counterpart
    - DEF notation looks like this:
        - ```Audicle{Bass}>> >>C#2 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | F#1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | B1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | A1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |```
      - Unlike ABC notation, DEF notation fully supports drums and lyrics
        - ```Audicle{Backbeat}>> >>B B . . S . . S . B B . . . S . | B B . B S . . S . . B B S . B S | B . . . S . . S . . B B S . B S | B . B . . . S . B B B B B B B B |```
