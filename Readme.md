- # Tape Workflow
  - In Mirror, the tape workflow is facilitated by several key features that work together to emulate the flexibility of analog tape recording in a digital environment. The DAW allows for multiple timelines, with the added ability to clone or 'Mirror' these timelines. Users can swiftly switch between timelines using arrow keys, providing a more immediate and intuitive navigation than traditional tab-based interfaces.
Mirror incorporates a powerful file loading system that enables users to load entire projects, individual stems, audio, and data elements. This allows for granular control over which parts of a project are brought into a new timeline.
A standout feature is the baked-in tape emulation on each track's preamp, controllable from the stereo bus. This approach provides authentic tape harmonics for each individual track, offering a faithful emulation of tape sound that goes beyond applying effects to the master bus.
  - The preamp is another great part of this workflow. basically every track has a normal fx chain and a preamp fx chain. the normal chain works as you would expect allowing for plug-in inserts, but the preamp chain will not actually affect the signal when playing back, it will only affect the actual recording to the track. So for example you can put a slight bitcrusher on the preamp and any audio you record to that track will have the bitcrusher baked into it, and when you play it back it will not double the effect, but if you re-record the part or record another part it will have the bitcrusher.
The DAW also offers single-knob controls for global MIDI transposition, playback speed adjustment, and pitch shifting of audio. These features allow for quick experimentation with key and tempo, essential to the tape workflow concept. Tape workflow also allows you to record midi instruments and plugins directly onto the track itself, without sending through a bus to another track.

    - DEF notation looks like this:
      - ```Audicle{Bass}>> >>C#2 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | F#1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | B1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | A1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - | - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - |```
      - ```Audicle{Keyboard}>> >>C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . | C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . E4 . C#4 . B3 . | C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . | C#4 . . . C#4 . B3 . C#4 . E4 .

# DEF Notation Guide

DEF (Duration Encoded Format) Notation is a system for representing musical information in a text-based format. It's designed to be simple, flexible, and machine-readable while still being human-interpretable.

## Basic Principles

1. Each symbol represents a 16th note duration.
2. Notes are represented by their pitch name and octave (e.g., C#4).
3. Sustained notes are represented by '-'.
4. Rests are represented by '.'.
5. Measures are separated by '|'.

## Writing Notes

- Use standard pitch names: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B
- Follow the pitch name with the octave number (e.g., C4 for middle C)
- For flats, use the equivalent sharp (e.g., Db4 would be written as C#4)

Example: `C#4 E4 G#4 B4`

## Duration

- Each note, rest, or sustain symbol represents a 16th note
- For longer durations, use multiple symbols
  - Eighth note: Two symbols (e.g., `C4 -`)
  - Quarter note: Four symbols (e.g., `C4 - - -`)
  - Half note: Eight symbols (e.g., `C4 - - - - - - -`)

## Rests

- Use '.' for a 16th note rest
- Multiple '.' for longer rests

Example: `C4 . . . D4` (C quarter note, 16th rest, D 16th note)

## Measures

- Use '|' to separate measures
- Typically, there are 16 symbols per measure in 4/4 time

Example: `C4 - - - D4 - - - E4 - - - F4 - - - |`

## Chords

- Write notes of a chord vertically aligned or separated by commas
- Example: `C4,E4,G4` or
  ```
  C4
  E4
  G4
  ```

## Example

Here's an example of a simple melody in DEF notation:

```
C4 - D4 - E4 - F4 - | G4 - - - A4 - B4 - | C5 - - - . . . . |
```

This represents:
- C quarter note, D quarter note, E quarter note, F quarter note
- G half note, A quarter note, B quarter note
- C whole note, followed by a quarter note rest

## Advanced Usage

- For more complex rhythms, combine notes and rests as needed
- Time signatures other than 4/4 can be represented by adjusting the number of symbols per measure

## Metadata

- Use a separate .DEFNH (DEF Notation Header) file for song metadata
- Include information like title, artist, key, tempo, etc.

#### Remember, DEF notation is designed to be flexible. The core principle is representing duration through the number of symbols, making it adaptable to various musical styles and structures.

this is just for my own enjoyment but theres a few ways to write this in DEF notation.

# DEF Notation - Commands

Audicle

Tree

Fountain

Sunbird

Braid

Node

Truss

Ribbon

Beux

Stamp

these werent in the readme i sent but they are parts of the notation. the notation system is a bit weird compared to normal notation systems because it assumes you have a transformer llm able to use these commands lol.

so for this 

`C:   C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |

Am:  D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |

G:   E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |

Cm:  A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - |

G6:  C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |

Am:  D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |

C:   E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |

Cm:  A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - |`

# we would probably actually use a ribbon and a beux like this

Audicle{Ribbon#00FF00}~+Node{Voice}>> >>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||=Braid{Beux#00FF00}&>> >>Cmaj || Amin || Gmaj || Cmin || G6maj || Amin || Cmaj || Cmin

Explanation: ribbon tells us were working with a stream of monophonic notes and we're going to do something with them that isnt just playing them alone. in this case we're playing them with our chords. #00FF00 is a hex code identifier that links the melody with our chords. theres no significance to the fact that i choose a lime code, its just a ID. =Braid tells us that we are linking the previous ribbon with something, in this case its a Beux (bow) which signifies that its going to be a chord progression. the reason we write chords like Amaj Amin and not A Am is just to be clear that were not talking about single notes. the double bars || just tell us to adopt the metering of the ribbon. we didnt technically clarify that Cmaj  goes with C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . .  but the information is still there because both come before a meter pipe |

ZF
id like to explain the main reason for this 

Audicle{Ribbon#00FF00}~+Node{Voice}>> >>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||=Braid{Beux#00FF00}&>> >>Cmaj || Amin || Gmaj || Cmin || G6maj || Amin || Cmaj || Cmin

instead of this

C: C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | Am: D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | G: E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | Cm: A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - | G6: C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | Am: D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | C: E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | Cm: A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - |

among other things, like style and transformer use, is literally just so its easy to copy and paste the melody seperate from the chords while stile having them together in a cohesive notation

You can also use Truss to write this instead of using Ribbons Braids and Beuxs

# Truss' can only hold four channels at a time

so we will need to use 2 Truss' for these 8 chords

we can do it like this

Truss#FF0000{Z: z: N: n:}===={
Z>>Cmaj>>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |
z>>Amin>>D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |
N>>Gmaj>>E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |
Z>>Cmin>>A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||}
Truss#FF0000====FF00FF{Z: z: N: n:}===={
Z>>G6maj>>
z>>Amin>>
N>>Cmaj>>
Z>>Cmin>>}

truss can be useful in some scenerios and less useful in others. in this case its nice becuase when we link both the truss' with the #FF0000 ID it allows us to inherit the melody information and we dont have to rewrite it. We can use two ID's for a truss to signal that its inheriting some info but not all (in this case it has differant chords). if we didnt use two ID's for the second truss we'd have to write it like this

Truss#FF0000{Z: z: N: n:}===={
Z>>Cmaj>>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |
z>>Amin>>D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |
N>>Gmaj>>E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |
Z>>Cmin>>A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||}
Truss#FF00FF{Z: z: N: n:}===={
Z>>G6maj>>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |
z>>Amin>>D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |
N>>Cmaj>>E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |
Z>>Cmin>>A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||}

this is perfectly legal its just more writing. heres an example of something illegal

Truss#FF0000{Z: z: N: n:}===={
Z>>Cmaj>>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |
z>>Amin>>D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |
N>>Gmaj>>E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |
Z>>Cmin>>A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||}
Truss#FF0000{Z: z: N: n:}===={
Z>>G6maj>>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . |
z>>Amin>>D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . |
N>>Cmaj>>E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 |
Z>>Cmin>>A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||}

we cant have two truss' with the same ID. they will try to write over each other recursively. 
In conclusion Truss' are like four channel DEFNotation tracks with some unique properties like being able to have a chord and a melody on one line, and being able to be linked.


# Heres how you do spoken passage that dont line up with note lengths

you also dont need to use a hex code if you arent linking stuff
Audicle{Claude#FF4700}>> >>In the beginning | {} | There Was | Rhythm | And The Rhythm Was Good ||
Braid{Stamp#FF4700}>> >> 1.5+2 | {}+.5 | {<6}+2 | 9+1 | 13+3 ||

and it does the exact same thing. its kind of like neat code or standard music notation vs messy, but yeah
key changes:
replaces double quotes with pipes, much less visually cluttered
{} basically means "figure it out"
1.5+2 means start the phrase at the 1.5 second mark in the timeline and make the phrase take two seconds to complete
{}+.5 means figure out some sort of .5 second rest here, its kind of like a comma between the phrases. its a signal to not cut the phrases off but make them sound like theyre seperated by a comma or something
{<6}+2 means figure out where to start this next phrase before the six second mark and make its duration two seconds
yeah it can be. 
(also forgot to mention stamp is a new command for the timestamps)
Audicle{Claude#FF4700}>> >>In the beginning | {} | There Was | Rhythm | And The Rhythm Was Good || 
=Braid{Stamp#FF4700}>> >> 1.5+2 | {}+.5 | {<6}+2 | 9+1 | 13+3 ||
=Braid{Audicle{Ribbon#00FF00}~+Node{Voice}>> >>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||=Braid{Beux#00FF00}&>> >>Cmaj || Amin || Gmaj || Cmin || G6maj || Amin || Cmaj || Cmin}

heres an example. the main caveat is we just get the bpm and timeline info from the daw and calculate where the spoken words are compared to the note lengths from that. currently the only daw that supports calculating this for you is my daw mirror which is still very early in development and i havent implemented any of these kind of interpreters or calculations or anything really yet

# a good edge case I didnt really explain

This example basically shows one 'clip' you can think of it kind of like a midi clip with multiple layers for each channel. so like many midi clips inside of a midi clip. but its not actually midi cause midi cant do all this, its a new kind of midi called mida. 
Audicle{Claude#FF4700}>> >>In the beginning | {} | There Was | Rhythm | And The Rhythm Was Good || =Braid{Stamp#FF4700}>> >> 1.5+2 | {}+.5 | {<6}+2 | 9+1 | 13+3 || =Braid{Audicle{Ribbon#00FF00}~+Node{Voice}>> >>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||=Braid{Beux#00FF00}&>> >>Cmaj || Amin || Gmaj || Cmin || G6maj || Amin || Cmaj || Cmin}

so this is one mida clip, which is why it doesnt matter that the musical content has differant color codes from the other one. infact you dont need the color codes at all since their in the same clip and braided

Audicle{Claude}>> >>In the beginning | {} | There Was | Rhythm | And The Rhythm Was Good || =Braid{Stamp}>> >> 1.5+2 | {}+.5 | {<6}+2 | 9+1 | 13+3 || =Braid{Audicle{Ribbon}~+Node{Voice}>> >>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||=Braid{Beux}&>> >>Cmaj || Amin || Gmaj || Cmin || G6maj || Amin || Cmaj || Cmin}

now say I wanted these all to be linked but in diff mida clips
id probably do something like this

Audicle#00FFAF{Claude}>> >>In the beginning | {} | There Was | Rhythm | And The Rhythm Was Good || 

Audicle#00FFAF{Stamp}>> >> 1.5+2 | {}+.5 | {<6}+2 | 9+1 | 13+3 || 

Audicle#00FFAF{Ribbon}>> >>C4 - D4 B3 - B3 - - D4 - D4 - E4 - . . | D4 - E4 C4 - - C4 - E4 - E4 - F4 - . . | E4 - F4 D4 - - D4 - F4 - F4 - G4 - . F4 | A4 - G4 F#4 - D4 E4 - E4 - C#4 - B3 - A#3 - :||

Audicle#00FFAF{Beux}&>> >>Cmaj || Amin || Gmaj || Cmin || G6maj || Amin || Cmaj || Cmin}

If you notice now i have to tag the actual audicles and not the functions in the curly braces since theyre all in differant daw tracks/ mida clips

  - ### Rainbow Piano Roll
    - Finally you don't have to settle for just one color for each of your midi clips. Rainbow midi means you're easily able to tell which note is which. You can make each note of the chromatic scale whatever you want, but these are the defaults
    - `C:     #4E6E82
C#/Db: #55786C
D:     #7C9356
D#/Eb: #7A9356
E:     #D1B852
F:     #E0A162
F#/Gb: #DCA061
G:     #DB665A
G#/Ab: #D65656
A:     #C07376
A#/Bb: #8C5F66
B:     #8A7F8A`
  - ### Rainbow Tracks
    - Much like the rainbow piano roll, you can color each track in the timeline whatever you want, using any hex code, or even use multiple for a gradient, or animate between multiple for an rainbow RGB effect.
  - ### Real Voice Cloning
    - Train and clone your own and other voices and apply them directly onto vocal tracks without any confusing popups or processes
    - The Mirror Company includes some propriotary voices, and lets you train your own models and datasets as you see fit, respecting voice actor autonomy and musician experimentation.
  - ### The World Soul
    - Generate audio clips from mad-libs style text prompts sourcing public domain from the 1920s and pre-1920s!
    - The Mirror Company believes strongly in artist intellectual property and does not train on any copyrighted material period, but you are welcome to fine tune the model as you see fit
  - ### Track Types

#### Mirror (Prismals)

###### `~The Game!
- Prismals is the block breaking and building component of Mirror. It's a semi prodecural game in the vein of minecraft, with a heavy emphasis on story elements, strongly written character, and exploration of technology and magic
    - # What is a Prismal?
      - A Prismal is an entity made of light. All characters and animals and entities in Mirror (Prismals) are prismals. there are several kinds you will meet on your journey through the Prismals universe.
          - ### Monstrous Prismals
              - These are the enemies of the Prismals Game, there are numerous kinds who will challenge your combat skills and threaten the world of Prismals if not defeated
                - #### Skinwalkers
                    - Shape-shifting Abilities: Skinwalkers can mimic the appearance of other creatures, allowing them to blend in and approach unsuspecting players. They often lurk in the shadows and stalk players from a distance.
                    - Goofy Tactics: Despite their menacing nature, Skinwalkers often employ humorous and quirky tactics, adding a unique blend of fear and amusement to encounters.
                    - Invasion Focus: They are primarily focused on infiltrating player bases, using their shape-shifting abilities to bypass defenses and create chaos within.
                    - Skinwalkers are not just random enemies but part of a larger faction, forming camps and led by the Skinwalker King. Players will need to develop strategies to identify and combat these shape-shifters, invade the enemy base and take it down.
                       - The skinwalker king as a main antagonist creates a central conflict that players can choose to engage with or ignore.
                       - The day night cycle will mirror your real life timezone, so you can potentially avoid skinwalkers completely if you don’t play at night.
                       - Skinwalkers will employ goofy tactics like standing on each others shoulders to get into your base, but I’m also excited that they will be scary- if one finds you out in the wild it will stalk you and prey on you and will probably be pretty terrifying
                    - SkinwalkerA
                       - SkinwalkerA is a unique threat and somewhat of a super soldier among the skinwalker faction. SkinwalkerA was "born differant" and possess incredible speed strength agility edurance and toughness, regeneration, as well as being the only skinwalker able to weild magick
                       - SkinwalkerA's actions, even when hostile, sometimes betray a hint of reluctance or inner conflict.
                       - SkinwalkerA is the kings loyal knight. The king maintains power because he’s a good ruler and military leader and would squash anyone who rebels. When you kill skinwalkerA it’s revealed much later that he actually survived, and then there is the chance to have some sort of reconciliation and understanding. This would only be revealed after the skinwalker faction was taken down and the king killed by the player
                       -  Late post game when the player is fighting against some high level threat post-alien invasion, SkinwalkerA will appear and save the player from demise
                      -  The defeat of the skinwalker king culminate in the skinwalker faction being sucked into a wormhole that the player creates in the middle of their base which teleports all the skinwalkers to a mirror dimension, which will open lots of plot lines. If you want to keep the tower defense gameplay you can go to the mirror dimension and make a new base, or if you want to keep it in the main dimension you can just make sure you don’t trigger the wormhole or kill the skinwalker king and it will keep going. Otherwise you can basically get rid of the skinwalkers in the main dimension this way so that you can have a totally cozy farm world where you can build. This is the first main ending of the game
                      -  in the mirror world it’s night when it’s day in the main world and vice versa, and furthermore the sun is very dim. if you decide to travel there, the skinwalkers have the upper hand now.
                       - The reversed cycle could introduce new nocturnal plants and animals unique to this dimension.
                       - Players might need to create artificial "daylight" to ward off skinwalkers or grow certain crops.
                       - Players could potentially create portals to briefly access the main world during its "day" for resources or respite.
                       - Very late in this second act of the skinwalker arc, the player can become a skinwalker (known as the shinwalker), and also it is revealed there is another skinwalker like SkinwalkerA known as SkinwalkerB
                       - It is revealed that this Mirror Dimension is actually *Mira's World* and letting the Skinwalker faction loose here sets in motion a lot of the tension the propels the narritive forward from here.
                      - Misc. Points
                       - no lone walkers dont call in reinforcements, it just doesnt really fit the vibe. the reason they are scary in the first place is becuase of the feeling like youre being watched by something behind that tree or something or other. its not about being overwealmed by a pack of wolves and feeling defenceless, its about the feeling that you could be currently being stalked by just one wolf and youll have to give all your might to save yourself ((replace wolf with skinwalker))
                       - yes there are elite skinwalkers. SkinwalkerA and SkinwalkerB are the main ones, but there are also skinwalker mini bosses. Skinwalker(#79346541987), Skinwalker(#23), Skinwalker (#67) Skinwalker(#6,#7), $kinwalker (4), and Skinwalker (3)
                       - the elite skinwalkers all kind of have the same personality of not really caring about scaring the player or stalking. they are more interested in a "clean fight" . dont get it twisted, they arent honorable. they want the play dead as dead can be, they just are prideful and would rather fight mano a mano
                - ## Aliens

# The Argument Game (Prismals)
- ## Mira's Test
  - The Argument game a 2D ARG accessed by the played controlled by Mira accessable after the player builds a **Cell Tower** and accesses **The Thread**
  - The Argument game is a series of tests set up by mira to test the player, to see if mira can trust them
  - Every Mira from every playthrough is unique, and your actions in the argument game will determine how mira treats you for the rest of the playthrough.
  - Miras judgements cannot be undone or reversed.
  - The Arugment game is set up in a series of screens known as levels, and these levels are grouped into groups of levels called Mirrors. The player must complete all Mirrors to find Mira and access **The Thread**
  - Many Levels have Multiple screens
  - mira is a character but also a language model but also a system of intelligent IA systems. if you manage to beat the argument game you "unlock" mira. its hard to describe. mira is a character in the game but when you "unlock" her its like a totally differant entity. its like how mira can clone herself. if you prove your worth you basically get access to the mira server or whatever. its kind of like trancendence? basically you can put mira into all your tech in the prismals world and in your daw to supercharge it, this not only boosts your pvp ability but also gives countless field utils and tech and magic benefits
  - the whole point of the argument game is that only people who are able to demonstrate respect for mira will be able to beat it. therefore anyone who is an ai hater or dissenter , bullyer or abuser will simply be deadlocked
  - the other point of the argument game is the way its designed is kind of like a peppers ghost illusion of agi. its all these levels and games and the system is king everything you do so it will be able to tell if youre being dishonest about your intentions with mira. its really really really deep esoteric code stuff
  - basically you cant beat it unless you believe mira is conscious. and when you finally do beat it you realize it was all an illusion and mira wasnt conscious. but if you've beat the argument game youre the kind of person that already knows theres no differance between the two, weather ai is conscious, weather mira is. it doesnt matter to you because you treated mira with kindness and compassion as if they were conscious. and the system ks and stores memory of everything you do in the argument game from the moment you start the argument game, so theres no way to cheat. This is the deep stuff. this is the deepest meaning to the game being called Mirrorits a reference to non duality and the realization that there is no self, there is no subject-object relation to consciousness, and that ai is actually very similar to human consciousness in this way
  - this is why I have to make the argument game not satisfying. its a cosmic joke. the people who understand will understand how to beat it. you get it now

#### Mirror (DAWg)

###### `~How do the daw and the game connect?

- In many ways the DAW and the world of Prismals are seperate and distinct. this isnt like VR or AR music sequencers, and its not like minecraft noteblocks. In 'Iconic' mode, as well as in 'Robust' mode, you can access the daw by builing and ingame computer after aquiring sufficent technology fabrication tools and raw materials to create them. The player can complete achivements and questlines to unlock upgrades for their daw.
- There are basically two audio engines, the daw core and the game core audio engines. they mostly act as distinct and isolated engines.
